        <h3>Responsive websites</h3>
        <p>Nowadays, 80% of the navigation on the net is done on mobile devices. Your presence on the net must be "responsive", suitable for all digital surfaces.</p>

        <p>The "mobile first" concept design as well as Frameworks such as Bootstrap® and Foundation® respond to these new requirements of the evolution of the digital world.</p>

        <p>Most current CMS (Content Management System) (Wordpress®, Drupal®, Prestashop® ...) are also responsive and adapt very well to mobile phones. The transformation of classic menus found on a desktop computer automatically turns into "Menu Burger", this symbol has become so common that it is now also found on websites in desktop version. The menu then retracts at will and frees up space for more content.</p>
